# ASL Recognition with Deep Learning
In this notebook, I will load, examine, and preprocess the data, then I train the convolutional neural network CNN (Deep learning model) to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. This training will test train the CNN performance.

# Tools:
Python libraries :
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras
